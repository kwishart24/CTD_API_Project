# CTD_API_Project
This is my final project for the Code the Dream Intro to Programming Class showcasing my ability to use 2 API endpoints.

To run locally, follow the instructions below:

1. Fork the repository and save a copy to your GitHub account.
2. Copy the SSH link to the code by clicking the green "Code" button in your new forked repository.
3. Go to Visual Studio Code and open the folder you'd like to save this project to.
4. Open a new terminal session.
5. In the terminal, make sure you're in the correct folder, then type "git clone {insert SSH link here}" and hit ENTER.
7. Then you can view the project in your web browser of choice by navigating to the index.html file in your file explorer and opening it in a web browser.
